        Following the collection Singular Unity presented in the Dominican Republic
        in 2017, LEBLANCSTUDIOS was a finalist at the Iberoamerican Design Biennial
        in Madrid 2018. With the collection Murder is My Business, the brand was
        invited to design a collection for the Memorial Museum of the Dominican
        Resistance. Afterwards. In 2019 we did a TEDxYouth Talk in Santo Domingo,
        where We discussed generating culture through fashion. That same year, Yamil
        Arbaje was an award winner of the Fashion Scholarship Fund with his project
        Calvin Klein Jeans x Dollar Tree. Later in 2020, Yamilâ€™s graduate collection
        work was selected among the best design portfolios by 1GRANARY x PINTEREST of
        2020.
